toDO:
    visual:
        - Add all progress live ans visible to the html so user see that stuff is happening.
    
    code:
        - add session Storage and cache aufrufe
        - wouldn't it be totally funny to rewrite all my code to work with search queries? FUCKING OPTIMIZING SOME CODE!!!!
            also getting ALL commits not just the once for your own repos 
            something like: "https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=author:manuel-hegner&type:pr"
        - maybe just change the days into percentage and just take the last 1000 commits? also show the total commits
